# Programming Assignment 0 - Practice Programming Assignment
                             

In this practice programming assignment we are going to take our first steps in Scala.

After setting up our tools, we are given this example project where we basically have to
make the tests pass! In order to do this, we should implement some basic `max` and `sum`
functions for a given list.

##### Challenges:

Avoid using loops - the point is to learn the functional programming principles !


##### Files Updated:

* [Lists.scala](src/main/scala/example/Lists.scala)
